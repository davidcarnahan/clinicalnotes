# Clinical Notes

This repository will grow over time. I am gathering synthetic example notes for the purposes of supporting analytics & machine learning work. Many of the notes were taken in part from mtsamples.com and modified as clinical or compliance necessity required. Some of the notes were developed by me personally and were based on realistic clinical scenarios but not on real patients.  Please notify me if you have any questions or suggestions: davidhcarnahan@gmail.com
